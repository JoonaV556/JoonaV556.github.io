(code inside /Assets/Scripts/)  
*All code inside /Assets/... is written by me and utilizes Photon Fusion 2 for multiplayer features*

This project is a straightforward multiplayer football game that primarily utilizes rigidbody-based physics.

It is my most recent personal game development project and is currently a work in progress (WIP).

The primary goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of multiplayer programming and replication, skills I will need for future projects :) 
  
Main features:
- 3D
- Multiplayer (1, 2, or 3 versus 3)
- Rigidbody physics (players push ball around with their bodies. players can also push each other)

Current features: 
- Lan multiplayer
- replicated players & ball
- scoring goals 

Planned features:
- game loop (simple match loop with warmup, game and victory phases)
- pvp tackling feature (players can tackle each other on the ground by jumping against each other with force)
- Matchmaking server for finding game sessions over internet

Tech stack:
- Unity 6
- Photon Fusion 2 networking library
