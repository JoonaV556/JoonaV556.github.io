GameRAT, a project funded by EMIL Horizon Europe, provides an innovative remote rehabilitation system for upper-body therapy. GameRAT combines a web interface for professionals to design and manage exercise routines with gamified Mixed Reality Application for patients to perform exercises at home. The system features four engaging minigames, such as potion-making and rowing, which encourage therapeutic movements while collecting detailed performance and motion data. AI-driven safety features and pain estimation tools enhance the patient experience, ensuring exercises are effective and safe.
