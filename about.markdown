I am a multidisciplinary games and software developer specializing in Virtual and Mixed Reality applications. Additionally, I am a hobbyist video game developer with a strong interest technology, art, and UX design.

Currently, I work as a Software Developer Intern at the Helsinki XR Center, where I develop VR/AR games and application prototypes using Unity, C#, and other relevant technologies. I have solid teamwork and communication skills, honed through participation in hackathons and collaborative work projects.

Although a bit shy at first, I am very friendly and love to help & support others when needed :)
