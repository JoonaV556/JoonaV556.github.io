I am a passionate game developer and a 4th year XR Design student. I like to build games and applications on my free time. 

I currently work as a software developer intern at Helsinki XR Center, developing VR/AR games and application prototypes with Unity, C# and other relevant technologies . I have solid teamwork & communication skills which have been put to test at hackathons and work projects.

Although a bit shy at first, I am very friendly and love to help & support others when needed :)
