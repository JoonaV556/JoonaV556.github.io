### Overview 
As part of the larger SkillBill project, I contributed to a VR application suite designed for educational simulations aimed at vocational students in technical fields. The suite includes two single-player modules and two multiplayer experiences. One single-player module focuses on the maintenance and operation of a Carbonate Fuel Cell system. The other allows students to explore a digital twin of a physical learning space at Metropolia, visualizing real-time sensor data to understand energy consumption in built environments. The multiplayer modules emphasize collaborative problem-solving: one challenges students to construct a functional ground heating system by correctly connecting components, while the other enables them to study power generation in vehicles, progressing from combustion engines to hybrid models and fully electric cars.

### My Role - Unity Development
[//]: # (xr app  (some important systems, busy/lots of responsibilities))
- C# Programming & Debugging
- Gameplay programming
- Multiplayer & Replication (Photon Fusion lib)
- UI / UX programming
- Profiling & optimization for Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3 MR headsets.

In the project, I worked mainly on the cooperative vehicular assembly simulation. Additionally, I developed a separate VR tutorial module, which goes through basics of VR interactions with controllers (grabbing items etc.). I Also developed the lobby level (UI interactions etc.), which allows the user to navigate between the modules.
